## GitHub workflow exercise

The goal is to give participants a hands-on experience with real-world collaboration using Git. 

An M&Ms guessing game will be coded, here a short intro:

Imagine a coffe shop and the owner wants to start a small initiative - some gamification where one can win a free coffee plus a piece of cake. 
So they prepare a jar with between 100 - 200 normal sized M&Ms (the owner knows the number) and the idea is that each client has five guesses to get the number of M&Ms correctly. 


## FIRST OF ALL:

If you use AI for coding, please stick to the very issue/ task that is given. Just solve the minimal unit as described. LLM's tend to blow up code suggestions and it might be that you're already 
solving the entire repo, but that is not the idea here.

## Start

The example starts with just the initialization/ definition of the function. After that use the issues plus labels to move forward.
